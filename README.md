# Fetch list

This is a very simple project with demonstration purposes only. It's a simple App that fetches data from an API and displays it.

The tools used are a total overkill for something so simple. However, as stated, it is only for demonstration:

- Custom hooks.
- Components.
- Styled components with a Theme provider and a Global style.
- Typescript.
- Testing with Jest and React testing library.
